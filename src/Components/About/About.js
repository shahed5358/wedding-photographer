As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue. As a Web developer, i want to to design Web pages that can effectively display material, provide interactivity, and be artistically pleasing to the client. </h4>
